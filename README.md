I am using the Django framework to build a graph that tracks the value of the coin TRX or TRON coin.
Later more will be added and this readme file will also be updated.

--So far the graph is able to be activated and deactivated to start or stop the tracking of the TRX coin, so far only TRX is being tracked but more will be added.
